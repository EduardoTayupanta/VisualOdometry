# Visual of Odometry Implementation in TensorFlow 2.2

This repository is an implementation of the following architectures:

- [DeepVO: Towards end-to-end visual odometry with deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7989236)
- [MagicVO: An End-to-End Hybrid CNN and Bi-LSTM Method for Monocular Visual Odometry](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8753500)

The code uses the FlowNetS pre-trained model [FlowNet: Learning Optical Flow with Convolutional Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7410673).
